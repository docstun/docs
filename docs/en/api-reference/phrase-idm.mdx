Phrase Identity Management (IDM) offers secure and centralized access to all Phrase products via a single login. It supports Single Sign-On (SSO), social login (Google, Microsoft, GitHub), and automated user provisioning through SAML and SCIM. With IDM, users can easily switch between products and organizations without repeated logins. Administrators can manage access and roles efficiently, ensuring compliance and streamlined onboarding across teams.
