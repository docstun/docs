Strings has been built by product people, for product people.

As a string management platform for key-based translations, Phrase Strings extracts segments of words from code repositories or design files to manage the entire translation process.

This is invaluable for adapting digital products and software - apps, websites and video games - to engage with global audiences at scale.
(No surprise that it is loved by developers, product designers, product managers, and translators alike.)
