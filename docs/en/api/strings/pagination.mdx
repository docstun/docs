title: Pagination
---

Endpoints that return a list or resources will usually return paginated results and include 25 items by default. To access further pages, use the `page` parameter:
```
$ curl -u EMAIL_OR_ACCESS_TOKEN "https://api.phrase.com/v2/projects?page=2"
```
Some endpoints also allow a custom page size by using the `per_page` parameter:
```
$ curl -u EMAIL_OR_ACCESS_TOKEN "https://api.phrase.com/v2/projects?page=2&per_page=50"
```
Unless specified otherwise in the description of the respective endpoint, `per_page` allows you to specify a page size up to 100 items.

## Link-Headers
We provide you with pagination URLs in the [Link Header field](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988). Make use of this information to avoid building pagination URLs yourself.
```
Link: <https://api.phrase.com/v2/projects?page=1>; rel="first", <https://api.phrase.com/v2/projects?page=3>; rel="prev", <https://api.phrase.com/v2/projects?page=5>; rel="next", <https://api.phrase.com/v2/projects?page=9>; rel="last"
```
Possible `rel` values are:

| Value | Description                        |
|-------|------------------------------------|
| next  | URL of the next page of results    |
| last  | URL of the last page of results    |
| first | URL of the first page of results   |
| prev  | URL of the previous page of results|

## Rate Limiting
All API endpoints are subject to rate limiting to ensure good performance for all customers. The rate limit is calculated per user:

- 1000 requests per 5 minutes
- 4 concurrent (parallel) requests

For your convenience we send information on the current rate limit within the response headers:

| Header                  | Description                                                       |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| X-Rate-Limit-Limit      | Number of max requests allowed in the current time period         |
| X-Rate-Limit-Remaining  | Number of remaining requests in the current time period           |
| X-Rate-Limit-Reset      | Timestamp of end of current time period as UNIX timestamp         |

If you should run into the rate limit, you will receive the HTTP status code `429: Too many requests`.

If you should need higher rate limits, [contact us](https://phrase.com/contact).

## Conditional GET requests / HTTP Caching

Note: Conditional GET requests are currently only supported for `locales#download` and `translations#index`

We will return an ETag or Last-Modified header with most GET requests. When you request a resource we recommend to store this value and submit them on subsequent requests as `If-Modified-Since` and `If-None-Match` headers. If the resource has not changed in the meantime, we will return the status `304 Not Modified` instead of rendering and returning the resource again. In most cases this is less time-consuming and makes your application/integration faster.

Please note that all conditional requests that return a response with status 304 don't count against your rate limits.
