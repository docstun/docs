### Application Formats
- **ARB (Application Resource Bundle)** - JSON-based format used for Flutter apps

## Translation Workflows

### Website Translation
Implement website translation by setting up a project and selecting the appropriate file format for your web content. Phrase Strings handles various web content formats and maintains HTML structure during translation.

### Application Translation
For mobile apps (iOS and Android), Phrase Strings provides specialized workflows:

1. **Android Studio Integration**:
   - Create a project with Android Strings (.xml) format
   - Install the Android Studio plugin
   - Push and pull locale files directly from the IDE

2. **iOS Integration**:
   - Create a project with iOS Localizable Strings (.strings) format
   - Use the CLI tool for configuration
   - Integrate string management into your build workflow

### App Store Descriptions
Translate app store metadata for both App Store and Google Play:
- App name/title (with character limitations)
- Descriptions (full and short)
- Keywords
- What's new information
- Marketing URLs

### Dynamic Content Translation
For content stored in databases (like blog posts or product information):
- Create a separate project for dynamic content
- Use a structured key naming system (e.g., `products.10.name`)
- Implement a sync process for uploading and downloading translations

## Translation Management

### Plural Forms
Phrase Strings automatically handles language-specific plural forms according to Unicode rules. Different languages have different plural rules (e.g., English has two forms, while other languages may have up to six).

### Term Bases
Term bases (translation glossaries) ensure consistent terminology:
- Store approved terms and their translations
- Automatically suggest the correct translation while editing
- Especially valuable for technical vocabulary, brand-specific language, and terms that should remain untranslated[9]

## Integrations

Extend Phrase Strings functionality by connecting with popular development tools:
- **Version Control**: GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket
- **Content Management**: Contentful
- **Project Management**: Jira
- **Design**: Sketch

## Best Practices

1. **Key Structure**: Develop a consistent naming convention for translation keys
2. **Context**: Provide context information for translators to ensure accurate translations
3. **Plural Handling**: Use proper plural forms based on the target language rules
4. **Separate Projects**: Keep static content and dynamic content in separate projects
5. **Regular Syncing**: Implement automated processes to sync translations with your application
