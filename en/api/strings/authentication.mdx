title: Authentication
---

There are two different ways to authenticate when performing API requests:

- E-Mail and password
- Oauth Access Token

## E-Mail and password
To get started easily, you can use HTTP Basic authentication with your email and password:
```
$ curl -u username:password "https://api.phrase.com/v2/projects"
```

## OAuth via Access Tokens
You can create and manage access tokens in your [profile settings](https://app.phrase.com/settings/oauth_access_tokens) in Translation Center or via the [Authorizations API](https://developers.phrase.com/api/#tag--Authorizations).

Simply pass the access token as the username of your request:
```
$ curl -u ACCESS_TOKEN: "https://api.phrase.com/v2/projects"
```
or send the access token via the `Authorization` header field:
```
$ curl -H "Authorization: token ACCESS_TOKEN" https://api.phrase.com/v2/projects
```

### Send via parameter
As JSONP (and other) requests cannot send HTTP Basic Auth credentials, a special query parameter `access_token` can be used:
```
curl "https://api.phrase.com/v2/projects?access_token=ACCESS_TOKEN"
```
You should only use this transport method if sending the authentication via header or Basic authentication is not possible.

## Two-Factor-Authentication
Users with Two-Factor-Authentication enabled have to send a valid token along their request with certain authentication methods (such as Basic authentication). The necessity of a Two-Factor-Authentication token is indicated by the `X-PhraseApp-OTP: required; :MFA-type` header in the response. The `:MFA-typefield` indicates the source of the token, e.g. `app` (refers to your Authenticator application):
```
X-PhraseApp-OTP: required; app
```
To provide a Two-Factor-Authentication token you can simply send it in the header of the request:
```
curl -H "X-PhraseApp-OTP: MFA-TOKEN" -u EMAIL https://api.phrase.com/v2/projects
```
Since Two-Factor-Authentication tokens usually expire quickly, we recommend using an alternative authentication method such as OAuth access tokens.

## Multiple Accounts
Some endpoints require the account ID to be specified if the authenticated user is a member of multiple accounts. You can find the eight-digit account ID inside [Translation Center](https://app.phrase.com/) by switching to the desired account and then visiting the account details page. If required, you can specify the account just like a normal parameter within the request.
