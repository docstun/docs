## API Endpoints

### EU data center
```
https://api.phrase.com/v2/
```

### US data center
```
https://api.phrase.com/v2/
```

The API is only accessible via HTTPS and the current version is v2, which results in a base URL like: https://api.phrase.com/v2/ depending on the datacenter.

## Usage
[curl](http://curl.haxx.se/) is used primarily to send requests to Phrase Strings in the examples. On most you'll find a second variant using the [Phrase Strings API v2 client](https://phrase.com/cli/) that might be more convenient to handle. For further information check its [documentation](https://support.phrase.com/hc/en-us/articles/5808300599068).

## Use of HTTP Verbs
Phrase Strings API v2 tries to use the appropriate HTTP verb for accessing each endpoint according to REST specification where possible:

| Verb   | Description                         |
|--------|-------------------------------------|
| GET    | Retrieve one or multiple resources  |
| POST   | Create a resource                   |
| PUT    | Update a resource                   |
| PATCH  | Update a resource (partially)       |
| DELETE | Delete a resource                   |

## Identification via User-Agent
You must include the User-Agent header with the name of your application or project. It might be a good idea to include some sort of contact information as well, so that we can get in touch if necessary (e.g. to warn you about Rate-Limiting or badly formed requests). Examples of excellent User-Agent headers:
```
User-Agent: Example Mobile App (example@phrase.com)
User-Agent: ACME Inc Python Client (http://example.com/contact)
```
If you don't send this header, you will receive a response with 400 Bad Request.

## Lists
When you request a list of resources, the API will typically only return an array of resources including their most important attributes. For a detailed representation of the resource you should request its detailed representation.

Lists are usually [paginated](/en/api/strings/pagination).

## Parameters
Many endpoints support additional parameters, e.g. for pagination. When passing them in a GET request you can send them as HTTP query string parameters:

```
$ curl -u EMAIL_OR_ACCESS_TOKEN "https://api.phrase.com/v2/projects?page=2"
```
When performing a POST, PUT, PATCH or DELETE request, we recommend sending parameters that are not already included in the URL, as JSON body:
```
$ curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"name":"My new project"}' -u EMAIL_OR_ACCESS_TOKEN https://api.phrase.com/v2/projects
```
Encoding parameters as JSON means better support for types (boolean, integer) and usually better readability. Don't forget to set the correct Content-Type for your request.

*The Content-Type header is omitted in some of the following examples for better readbility.*

## Errors
### Request Errors
If a request contains invalid JSON or is missing a required parameter (besides resource attributes), the status `400 Bad Request` is returned:
```
{
  "message": "JSON could not be parsed"
}
```
### Validation Errors
When the validation for a resource fails, the status `422 Unprocessable Entity` is returned, along with information on the affected fields:
```
{
  "message": "Validation Failed",
  "errors": [
    {
      "resource": "Project",
      "field": "name",
      "message": "can't be blank"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Date Format
Times and dates are returned and expected in [ISO 8601](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) date format:
```
YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ
```
Instead of 'Z' for UTC time zone you can specify your time zone's locale offset using the following notation:
```
YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS¬±hh:mm
```
Example for CET (1 hour behind UTC):
```
2015-03-31T13:00+01:00
```
Please note that in HTTP headers, we will use the appropriate recommended date formats instead of ISO 8601.

## JSONP
The Phrase Strings API supports [JSONP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP) for all GET requests in order to deal with cross-domain request issues. Just send a `?callback` parameter along with the request to specify the Javascript function name to be called with the response content:
```
$ curl "https://api.phrase.com/v2/projects?callback=myFunction"
```
The response will include the normal output for that endpoint, along with a `meta` section including header data:
```
myFunction({
  {
    "meta": {
      "status": 200,
      ...
    },
    "data": [
      {
        "id": "1234abcd1234abc1234abcd1234abc"
        ...
      }
    ]
  }
});
```
To authenticate a JSONP request, you can send a valid [access token](/en/api/strings/authentication#oauth-via-access-tokens) as the `?access_token` parameter along the request:
```
$ curl "https://api.phrase.com/v2/projects?callback=myFunction&access_token=ACCESS-TOKEN"
```
